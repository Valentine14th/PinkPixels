# Find the Facts

This project, developped during the **2024 #herHack hackathon**, was selected by **SRG-SSR, the national swiss media coroporation**, as a **finalist and one of the top 2 submissions** for the media literacy challenge, based on its strong alignment with the challenge requirements, particularly its suitability for the target age group and context, as well as the quality of the minimum viable product.

The challenge focused on finding innovative ways to promote media literacy among primary school children, who are increasingly exposed to digital content online. The goal was to create a solution that could be used in classroom and/or museums. We chose to center our project around the topic of fake news, which young children are especially likely to fall for. 

Our goal was to make the learning process engaging and accessible by gamifying it through an escape room-style experience. To help children concentrate on the content while enjoying the game, we used a format they’re already familiar with: spot-the-difference.

In this game, a child is "trapped" in their room until they complete research for a school poster on turtles. Their parents won’t let them out until the task is done. To gather the necessary information, the player explores the room, interacting with various media elements. The challenge is to distinguish trustworthy sources (such as those from SRG) from fake news and misleading content. Once all reliable information has been collected, the child is free to go play with his friends!
